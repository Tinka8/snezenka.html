                1. a city I always enjoy visiting is Budapest, the capital of Hungary. 
                It is situated on the river Danube in the north of Hungary 
                and it has about two million inhabitants.

                2. In my opinion, Budapest is one of the most
                attractive cities in Europe. The centre is full of
                elegant streets and squares, fine buildings and
                beautiful bridges. It's a good city for walking,
                especially in the hills on the western side, from
                where there are amazing views of the river and
                the city centre. There's a relaxed atmosphere,
                the food is great and the public transport is
                superb. The Parliament, the Castle District and
                the fascinating Sz6chenyi Baths are probably
                the best-known tourist attractions.

                3. Perhaps my favourite spot in Budapest is
                Margaret Island, in the middle of the Danube.
                Although it's in the heart of the ciry it's a
                peaceful place, fuIl of old trees, fountains and
                flower gardens. There's even a Japanese garden,
                where you can see the famous sunbathing
                turtles! Cars have been banned from the island,
                so it's a good place to ;'og, cycle, swim or just
                unwind. I think the island looks most attractive
                on sunny, spring mornings after the long winter
                months. A few hours on the island always
                relaxes me and puts me in a good mood.

                4. In short, Budapest is a beautiful, historic city
                with something of interest for visitors of all
                ages. It really is worth a visit and I hope to go
                back there soon
