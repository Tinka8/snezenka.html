                    1. a city I always enjoy visiting is Budapest, the capital of Hungary. 
                    It is situated on the river Danube in the north of Hungary 
                    and it has about two million inhabitants.
                </div>
                <div class="yellow">
                    2. In my opinion, Budapest is one of the most
                    attractive cities in Europe. The centre is full of
                    elegant streets and squares, fine buildings and
                    beautiful bridges. It's a good city for walking,
                    especially in the hills on the western side, from
                    where there are amazing views of the river and
                    the city centre. There's a relaxed atmosphere,
                    the food is great and the public transport is
                    superb. The Parliament, the Castle District and
                    the fascinating Sz6chenyi Baths are probably
                    the best-known tourist attractions.
                </div>
                <div class="pinkie">
                    3. Perhaps my favourite spot in Budapest is
                    Margaret Island, in the middle of the Danube.
                    Although it's in the heart of the ciry it's a
                    peaceful place, fuIl of old trees, fountains and
                    flower gardens. There's even a Japanese garden,
                    where you can see the famous sunbathing
                    turtles! Cars have been banned from the island,
                    so it's a good place to ;'og, cycle, swim or just
                    unwind. I think the island looks most attractive
                    on sunny, spring mornings after the long winter
                    months. A few hours on the island always
                    relaxes me and puts me in a good mood.
                </div>
                <div class="yellow">
                    4. In short, Budapest is a beautiful, historic city
                    with something of interest for visitors of all
                    ages. It really is worth a visit and I hope to go
                    back there soon
